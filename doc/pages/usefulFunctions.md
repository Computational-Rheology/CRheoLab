This page is dedicated to the useful Functions for the volSacalarField

### General Information (Miguel)
Interaction with Vol class and compatibility with scalarField, Explain how the Invariants and max and min are computed

line2

line3


----
### Shift Field (Paulo)
line1

line2

line3

Shift the field with a constant (scalar, vector, symTensor and tensor)
The constant is the
minimum value
maximum value


----
### Scale Field (Paulo)
line1

line2

line3

Scale the field with a constant scalar (same documentation as Shift)


----
### Vector Field related (Karinate)
line1

line2

line3

Project the vectors in one direction
Create a scalarField with the magnitude of the vector


----
### Tensor Field related (Mohamed)
line1

line2

line3

Create a vector field with component of the tensor in one direction
Create a scalarField with the Tensor Invariants (I1, I2 and I3)
